# My Portfolio - React Project

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website! This project serves as a showcase of my skills, experiences, and projects. Below, you'll find information about the technologies used, how to set up the project, and some additional notes.

## Technologies Used

### 1. React
This portfolio is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for the creation of reusable components, making the code modular and maintainable.

### 2. React Router
To enable smooth navigation between different sections of the portfolio, React Router is utilized. It helps in creating a single-page application experience by handling routing without causing a full page reload.

### 3. Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS is employed for styling the portfolio. It is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build designs directly in your markup. This allows for a more efficient and flexible styling process.

### 4. ShadcnUi
ShadcnUi is a custom UI library designed to enhance the visual aesthetics of the portfolio. It provides a set of pre-designed components and styles to create a modern and appealing user interface.

### 5. AceternityUI
AceternityUI is integrated to add additional UI components and features to the portfolio. It enhances the user experience with its collection of customizable components.

### 6. TypeScript
This project is written in TypeScript, adding static typing to enhance code quality and development experience.

### 7. Vite
Vite is used as the build tool for this project. It provides a fast and efficient development environment with features like hot module replacement (HMR) and optimized production builds.

### Design
The website's design was created from scratch using Figma, allowing for a custom and unique visual experience.
